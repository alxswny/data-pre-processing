## Aridity Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [the Global Aridity - Annual](http://www.cgiar-csi.org/data/global-aridity-and-pet-database) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/43d9dac0-88be-4db1-b71e-482756220817).

The source provided the data as a GeoTIFF file within a zipped folder. The GeoTIFF inside the zipped folder was not modified from the original version for display on Resource Watch.

Please see the [Python script](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/blob/master/cli_030_rw1_aridity/cli_030_rw1_aridity_processing.py) for more details on this processing.

You can view the processed Aridity dataset [on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/43d9dac0-88be-4db1-b71e-482756220817).

You can also download the original dataset [directly through Resource Watch](http://wri-projects.s3.amazonaws.com/resourcewatch/raster/cli_030_rw1_aridity.zip), or [from the source website](https://cgiarcsi.community/2019/01/24/global-aridity-index-and-potential-evapotranspiration-climate-database-v2/).
