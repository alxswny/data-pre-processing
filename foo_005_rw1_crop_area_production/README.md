## Crop Land Area and Production Dataset Pre-processing

This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [the Crop Land Area and Production](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/PRFF8V&version=4.0) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/54af072c-7bb5-4bb1-af84-ea7ba0b4fc22).

The data was provided by the source as three zip files containing multiple TIFF files. The files show the harvest area, production area, and yield for several crops, disaggregated by specific technologies. Only files encompassing maize, soybean, wheat, rice, coffee, and cotton crops were processed at the complete crop level were used (combining all technologies for a total).

Please see the [Python script](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/blob/master/foo_005_rw1_crop_area_production/foo_005_rw1_crop_area_production_processing.py) for more details on this processing.
