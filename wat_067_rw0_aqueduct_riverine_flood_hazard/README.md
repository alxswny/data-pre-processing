## Aqueduct Riverine Flood Hazard Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [the {dataset formal name}]({learn more link}) for [display on Resource Watch]({link to dataset's metadata page on Resource Watch}).

{Describe how the original data came from the source.}

Below, we describe the steps used to {describe how you changed the data, e.g., "combine shapefiles for each continent into one global table on Carto"}.

1. {Describe what you did in numbered steps if it is useful.}
```
Include any SQL or GEE code you used in a code snippet.
```

Please see the [Python script]({link to Python script on Github}) for more details on this processing.

You can view the processed {Resource Watch public title} dataset [on Resource Watch]({link to dataset's metadata page on Resource Watch}).

You can also download the original dataset [directly through Resource Watch]({s3 link if available}), or [from the source website]({download from source link}).

###### Note: This dataset processing was done by [Daniel Gonzalez](https://www.wri.org/profile/daniel-gonzalez), and QC'd by [{name}]({link to WRI bio page}).


## Aridity Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [the Global Aridity - Annual](http://www.cgiar-csi.org/data/global-aridity-and-pet-database) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/43d9dac0-88be-4db1-b71e-482756220817).

The source provided the data as a GeoTIFF file within a zipped folder. The GeoTIFF inside the zipped folder was not modified from the original version for display on Resource Watch.

Please see the [Python script](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/blob/master/cli_030_rw1_aridity/cli_030_rw1_aridity_processing.py) for more details on this processing.

You can view the processed Aridity dataset [on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/43d9dac0-88be-4db1-b71e-482756220817).

You can also download the original dataset [from the source website](https://cgiarcsi.community/2019/01/24/global-aridity-index-and-potential-evapotranspiration-climate-database-v2/).
