## Coral Reef Connectivity Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to the [50 Reefs Global Coral Ocean Warming, Connectivity and Cyclone Dataset](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/conl.12587) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/2e7527a0-c601-4e5a-a205-492314501744).

The dataset is contained within a shapefile, which contains several attributes The following variable is shown on Resource Watch:
- Coral Reef Connectivity: The estimated degree to which coral reefs are able to exchange eggs, larvae, juveniles, or adults with other coral reefs. The degree of connectivity may be due to location, ocean currents, species present, etc.

One attribute within the shapefile was visualized on the Resource Watch platform without any additional processing or manipulation.
