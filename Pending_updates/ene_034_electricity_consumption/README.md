This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to the [U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) International Energy Statistics Electricity Net Consumption dataset](https://www.eia.gov/beta/international/data/browser/#/?pa=0000002&c=ruvvvvvfvtvnvv1vrvvvvfvvvvvvfvvvou20evvvvvvvvvvvvuvs&ct=0&tl_id=2-A&vs=INTL.2-2-AFG-BKWH.A&vo=0&v=H&start=1980&end=2016) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/eef10736-8d8b-4ac9-a715-ef0653a83196).

This dataset was provided by the source as a csv, which you can download using the link above. The csv table was converted from wide to long form, using Python.

Please see the [Python script](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/blob/master/ene_034_electricity_consumption/ene_034_electricity_consumption_processing.py) for more details on this processing.

You can view the processed dataset for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/eef10736-8d8b-4ac9-a715-ef0653a83196).
