## Global Hunger Index Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [2019 Global Hunger Index dataset](https://www.globalhungerindex.org/download/all.html) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/foo015a-Global-Hunger-Index).

This dataset was provided by the source as a pdf report. The data shown on Resource Watch can be found in Table 2.1 Global Hunger Index Scores By 2019 GHI Rank, which is on page 17 of the report.

This table was read into Python as a dataframe. The data was cleaned, values listed as '<5' were replaced with 5, and the the table was converted from wide to a long form.

Countries with insufficient data but significant cause for concern were not included in the source's data table, but they were noted [by the source](https://www.globalhungerindex.org/results.html#box-2-1). A new column was added to the table to store a flag for "Insufficient data, significant concern," and rows were added to the table for each of these countries noted by the source. 

Please see the [Python script](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/blob/master/foo_015a_global_hunger_index/foo_015a_global_hunger_index_processing.py) for more details on this processing.
