## Malaria Extent Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [the Malaria Extent](https://map.ox.ac.uk/explorer/#/explorer) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/3db2f914-2c70-431c-8dce-5dd961bccbd5).

The source provided the data as GeoTIFF files within a zipped folder. The GeoTIFF files inside the zipped folder were not modified from the original version for display on Resource Watch.

Please see the [Python script](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/blob/master/soc_037_rw1_malaria_extent/soc_037_rw1_malaria_extent_processing.py) for more details on this processing.
