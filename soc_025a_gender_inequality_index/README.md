## Gender Inequality Index Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [the Gender Inequality Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/gender-inequality-index-gii) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/soc025-Gender-Inequality-Index).

The original data is downloadable in a .xlsx format.  

Below, we describe the steps used to reformat the table so that it is formatted correctly to upload to carto.  We read in the data as a pandas dataframe, deleted columns and rows without data, and renamed the columns.  Then we converted the '..' to 'None'.  

Please see the [Python script](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/blob/master/soc_025a_gender_inequality_index/soc.025%20Gender%20Inequality%20Index.ipynb) for more details on this processing.

You can view the processed Gender Inequality Index dataset [on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/soc025-Gender-Inequality-Index).
