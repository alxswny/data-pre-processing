## Crop Suitability Class Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to the [Crop Suitability Class](https://gaez-data-portal-hqfao.hub.arcgis.com/pages/theme-details-theme-4).

The source provided the data in multiple TIFF files available for download via URL. The TIFFs show crop suitability index in classes for multiple timeframes and input technologies. Only files encompassing cotton, coffee, and rice were downloaded.

Please see the [Python script](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/blob/master/foo_067_rw0_global_crop_suitability_class/foo_067_rw0_global_crop_suitability_class_processing.py) for more details on this processing.
