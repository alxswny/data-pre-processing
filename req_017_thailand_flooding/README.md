## Thailand Flooding Pre-processing

This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to create the [Thailand Flooding dataset](https://resourcewatch.org/admin/data/datasets/0fb4086b-37d7-464d-9eaf-b9104d8992ad) used as a swipey for the [Climate-related Physical Risks](https://resourcewatch.org/dashboards/408).

The modified files shown on the dashboard were provided by [Lihuan Zhou](https://www.wri.org/profile/lihuan-zhou) from the Finance Center via email. They were then uploaded to Google Earth Engine. The original files were modified by Lihuan to include two white rectangles and text, highlighting nearby Sony and Honda factories that were affected by the floods.

The original files are from the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) on NASA's Earth Observing-1 satellite and the United States geological Survey. These images are available for display and download on NASA's Earth Observatory [Image of the Day](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/76234/floods-swamp-historic-city-in-thailand) for October 27, 2011.
