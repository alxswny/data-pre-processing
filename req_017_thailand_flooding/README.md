## Thailand Flooding Pre-processing

This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to create the [Thailand Flooding dataset](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/76234/floods-swamp-historic-city-in-thailand) for display on [Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/embed/map-swipe?zoom=10.124765919920378&lat=14.348293168896923&lng=100.57237782742156&layers=065b68fa-19af-4381-b5bf-8dd31d0a1309,23f38c8a-d7dc-4549-9e72-da5c576f4c31) to be included in the [Climate-related Physical Risks dashboard](https://resourcewatch.org/dashboards/climate-related-physical-risks).

This dataset contains satellite imagery, provided by the source as geotiff files. These files come from the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) on NASA's Earth Observing-1 satellite and the United States Geological Survey. These images were modified to include two white rectangles and text, highlighting the Sony and Honda factories that were affected by the October 2011 floods in Thailand. These modifications were done by [Lihuan Zhou](https://www.wri.org/profile/lihuan-zhou) and shared with the Resource Watch team via e-mail. The modified images were then uploaded to Google Earth Engine so that they could be displayed on Resource Watch. The original images are available for display and download on NASA's Earth Observatory [Image of the Day](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/76234/floods-swamp-historic-city-in-thailand) for October 27, 2011.

###### Note: This dataset processing was done by [Daniel Gonzalez](https://www.wri.org/profile/daniel-gonzalez) and [Lihuan Zhou](https://www.wri.org/profile/lihuan-zhou).
