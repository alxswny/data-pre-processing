## Hydropolitical Tension and Institutional Vulnerability Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [the Relative Risk Category for Hydropolitical Tension and Institutional Vulnerability](http://transboundarywaters.science.oregonstate.edu/content/transboundary-waters-assessment-programme-river-basins-component) for [display on Resource Watch](http://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/bc30d648-2a4f-4f5f-8a1c-b7a471e412bd).

The source provided the data in a zipped file containing two shapefiles - one of which contains the data for 310 international basins and the other contains the data for 812 basin country units. The shapefile for basin country unit was used.

Below, we describe the steps used to reformat the shapefile to upload it to Carto.

1. Read in the polygon shapefile as a geopandas dataframe.
2. Project the data so its coordinate system is WGS84.
3. Convert the data type of column 'runoff', 'withdrawal', and 'consumpt' to float.
2. Convert the data type of column 'HydroPolTe' and 'InstitVuln' to integer.
3. Convert the column names to lowercase to meet the column name requirements of Carto.
4. Convert the geometries of the data from shapely objects to geojsons.
5. Create a new column from the index of the dataframe to use as a unique id column (cartodb_id) in Carto.
6. Convert the NaNs in numeric columns to None to meet the import requirements of Carto.
