## Global Terrorism Index Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [Global Terrorism Index 2019 dataset](http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2020/02/GTI-2019-overall-scores-2002-2018.xlsx) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/soc093-Global-Terrorism-Index).

This dataset was provided by the source as an excel file. The file includes the overall Global Terrorism Index score for 163 countries or independent territories from 2002 to 2018.

The spreadsheet was read into Python as a dataframe. The data was cleaned, and the the table was converted from wide to a long form.
