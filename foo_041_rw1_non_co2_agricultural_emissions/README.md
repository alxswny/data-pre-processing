This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [Non-COâ‚‚ Agricultural Emissions](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GT) for [display on Resource Watch](https://bit.ly/3aUxqvK).

The source provided this dataset as a csv file [data explorer](http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Emissions_Agriculture_Agriculture_total_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip
). 

Below we describe the main steps taken to process the file:

1. The file was filtered to only show the "Agriculture total" item.
2. The file was filtered to only show CO2eq emissions.
3. A column showing the conversion from gigagrams to gigatonnes was created.

Please see the [Python script](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/blob/master/foo_041_rw1_non_co2_agricultural_emissions/foo_041_rw1_non_co2_agricultural_emissions_processing.py) for more details on this processing.

You can view the processed dataset for [display on Resource Watch](https://bit.ly/3aUxqvK).
