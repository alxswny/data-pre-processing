## Environmental Performance Index Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [the Environmental Performance Index](https://epi.yale.edu/) for [display on Resource Watch](http://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/faaf0a0f-7475-49f3-bb8b-68edfaad4b77).

The source provided the data as a csv file. Columns were renamed to be more descriptive and to remove special characters so that it can be uploaded to Carto without losing information.

Please see the [Python script](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/blob/master/soc_021_rw1_environmental_performance_index/soc_021_rw1_environmental_performance_index_processing.py) for more details on this processing.

You can view the processed Environmental Performance Index dataset [on Resource Watch](http://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/faaf0a0f-7475-49f3-bb8b-68edfaad4b77).

You can also download the original dataset [directly through Resource Watch](https://wri-public-data.s3.amazonaws.com/resourcewatch/soc_021_rw1_environmental_performance_index.zip), or [from the source website](https://epi.yale.edu/downloads).
