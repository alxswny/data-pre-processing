## Vulnerability to Climate Change Index Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [the ND-GAIN Country Index dataset](https://gain.nd.edu/our-work/country-index/) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/cli029a-Vulnerability-to-Climate-Change-Index).

This dataset comes in a zipped file containing data for the ND-GAIN Index, as well as several other scores and sub-indices, from 1995-2019.

On Resource Watch, we show the ND-GAIN Index, and also include information on each country's Readiness, Vulnerability, and Food Vulnerability Scores.

In order to upload the selected data on Resource Watch, the following steps were followed:

1. Download and unzip source data.
2. The source provides the data with each row representing a country and each year of data stored in a different column. This is considered to be "wide" form. We converted each of those files from wide form to long form, in which there is one column that indicates the year and one column that indicates the value for that year.
3. Merge the four tables for ND-GAIN Index, Readiness Score, Vulnerability, and Food Vulnerability Score into one table that has a column to store the value for each.
4. Rename the column 'Name' to 'country' to match the column name in the previous Carto table. 
5. Convert the column names to lowercase to meet the column name requirements of Carto.

Please see the [Python script](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/blob/master/cli_029_rw2_vulnerability_to_climate_change/cli_029_rw2_vulnerability_to_climate_change_processing.py) for more details on this processing.
