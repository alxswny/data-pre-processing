## Wetlands Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database: Lakes and Wetlands Grid (Level 3)](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/global-lakes-and-wetlands-database) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/098b3d64-3679-4448-bf05-039dc0224dd5).

The source provided the data as an ESRI Grid file within a zipped folder. In order to display this data on Resource Watch, the ESRI Grid file was converted to a GeoTIFF.

Please see the [Python script](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/blob/master/wat_039_rw0_wetlands/wat_039_rw0_wetlands_processing.py) for more details on this processing.

You can view the processed Wetlands dataset [on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/098b3d64-3679-4448-bf05-039dc0224dd5).
