## Forest Landscape Integrity Index Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to the [Forest Landscape Integrity Index](https://www.forestintegrity.com/) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/).

This dataset is provided by the source as a (zipped) GeoTIFF file. The following variables are shown on Resource Watch:
- 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index: Continuous index representing the degree of forest anthropogenic modification for the beginning of 2019 
 
Because the data were already provided in a compatible format and projection, very little processing was necessary to display this data on Resource Watch.

Please see the [Python script](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/blob/master/for_031_rw0_forest_landscape_integrity_index/for_031_rw0_forest_landscape_integrity_index_processing.py) for more details on this processing.

You can view the processed dataset for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/).

You can also download the original dataset [from the source website](https://www.forestintegrity.com/download-data).
